	        Cancelling a Task:
	        The Future interface defines the following method that allows you to cancel a task:
	        boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)

	        This method returns false if the task has already completed, has already been cancelled, or could not be cancelled for some other reason.
	        If this method returns true:
	        - The task will never run if it has not started.

	        - In case the task has already started, you can decide to interrupt the thread executing the task by specifying the flag mayInterruptIfRunning = true. Otherwise, the task continues until completes.

	        For example, the following code will cancel the task if it has been running longer than 3 seconds:
